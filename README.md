unicorn2: Control processes running the unicorn server software
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One recipe at this time -- unicorn::default. This recipe:

* installs a `unicorn_rack` service meant to manage several unicorn services
  (see more below)
* configures any hosts in the `/etc/default/unicorn.json` file from databags
  (see examples) and node configuration.
* restarts the service if the above has changed in any way.

The `unicorn_rack` script
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This script lives in `/etc/init.d/unicorn_rack`, and is installed as service.
The script itself takes two arguments: the directive (stop, start, restart,
reload) and the name of the app. **If the name of the app is omitted all apps
will recieve the actions taken for the directive.**

databags and the `unicorn.conf` file
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `/etc/unicorn.conf` file is generated by the recipe, and looks a bit like this:

    /www/chef-dashboard:/www/chef-dashboard/config/unicorn.rb:unicorn:rails
    /www/jsonip:/www/jsonip/config/unicorn.rb:unicorn:rails

The key is the path to the application, it will be started from that directory.

Databags and node configuration are used to generate this file. Instead of
mimicing the structure for the init script, we've provided something a little
more streamlined:

    {
      "id": "jsonip",
      "path": "/www/jsonip",
      "bin": "unicorn",
      "config_path": "/www/jsonip/config/unicorn.rb",
      "hosts": [ "coffee" ]
    }

Where `hosts` is an array of node names, and the path is the key of the data
structure above. Note that node configuration looks exactly the same and the
key for the node and the databag name searched are both `applications`.

**NOTE**: For those of you using the older cookbook with the `unicorn.json`
file, this will be removed on the next run after this cookbook is uploaded and
replaced by the `/etc/unicorn.conf` file.

User accounts (aka BUGS)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The recipes expect a `rails` user and group to exist. **It creates it for
you**.
